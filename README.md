# Collatz-Grapher: math and hailstones #

The <i>Collatz Conjecture</i> is a famous unsolved problem in mathetmatics which asks if all natural numbers will eventually reach 1 if they are continually fed as arguments to a function <i>f</i>, defined as <i>f(n) = n / 2</i> if <i>n mod 2 = 0</i>, or <i>f(n) = 3n + 1</i> if <i>n mod 2 = 1</i>.
