# Collatz-Grapher: math and hailstones #

The <i>Collatz Conjecture</i> is a famous unsolved problem in mathetmatics which asks if all natural numbers will eventually reach 1 if they are continually passed  as arguments to a mapping <i>f</i>, defined as <i>f(n) = n / 2</i> if <i>n mod 2 = 0</i>, or <i>f(n) = 3n + 1</i> if <i>n mod 2 = 1</i>, for <i>n > 0</i>.

There is no complete formal proof of this conjecture, but it is widely believed to be true, even "large" numbers eventually reaching 1 after a series of steps. The result of my program can be seen below:

Unfortunately, my program does nothing to prove the Collatz conjecture, but it does produce a very pretty graph. You can run Collatz-Grapher exactly like I do in the photo below:

In closing, here's a quote about the Collatz conjecture by the famous mathematician Paul Erdos:
